Documentation of EM-Bright
==========================

Introduction:
-------------
Binary system of neutron stars and black holes are some of the strongest
and best understood emitters of gravitational waves. Additionally, when 
a system has a neutron star then there is also a finite probability of 
disrupted baryonic matter present after the coalescence. This disrupted 
matter could be either from physical collision of the two compact objects
as in the case of a binary neutron star (BNS), or from tidal interactions
between the two compact objects with at least one of them being a neutron
star (NS). This baryonic matter is generally extremely neutron rich, and
will undergo r-process neucleosynthesis producing heavy elements that 
subsequently goes through nuclear fission, producing large quantity of
energy. This may result in an electromagnetic signal, commonly known as
a Kilonova. Simultaneous observation of Kilonova and gravitational wave
resulting from the coalescence of the gravitational wave is one of the 
most sought after astrophysical transient phenomenon. However, these
events are much rapidly evolving than supernova, and the localization
region of gravitational wave can be seperal tens of square degree large.
Thus, early knowledge about the possibility of an electromagnetic 
counterpart of a gravitational wave event can be helpful for observers.
The EM-Bright package provides tools for computing probability of the 
presence of electromagnetic counterpart in a merger of two compact binary 
objects.
